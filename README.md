📚 Rural School Attendance Management System – Project Description

The Rural School Attendance Management System is a digital solution designed to simplify and modernize the attendance process in rural educational institutions. Many rural schools still rely on manual registers, which are time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to maintain. This system provides an easy, fast, and reliable method for recording and tracking student attendance.

✨ Key Features

Daily Attendance Marking: Teachers can quickly mark students as Present, Absent, or Late using a simple interface.

Class-wise & Date-wise Records: Attendance can be viewed for any class or specific date.

Monthly Attendance Report: Automatically generates attendance percentages for each student.

Low-Internet Friendly: Designed lightweight so it works even in areas with limited connectivity.

Secure Login System: Only authorized teachers or admin can manage attendance.

Data Backup: Ensures records are not lost and can be exported for school administration.
